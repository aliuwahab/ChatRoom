# Chatroom
This is a simple open source chat system developed with elixir phoenix you can use in your project.

## Description:
Here are the simple system specs.

   1. Users should be able to log in. (Again, this would be similar to the new session page we created in the course.)
   2. Users can chat in a community forum either anonymous or by login identity
   3. Users can chat with each other privately. 
   4. After login, the users should land in a "lobby" page where they have a large text area welcoming them. 
        They should also have an input box that allows them to send messages to community forum straight away. 



#Local Environment Setup
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Clone the project
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
